## Future optimizations/ issues

- what if a tx is indexed for one account, also needs to be indexed for another account because thats the receiver of the tx. What happens currently?
- how important are virtual ops?
- for hive tx, do we need to distinguish between the tx? (also store op type) "delegate_vesting_shares" will probably be relevant?
